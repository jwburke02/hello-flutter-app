# hello_flutter_app

This is a simple flutter application designed using documentation tutorials from Flutter.

Documentation I found useful in creating this (From Flutter):
- https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout
- https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation/navigation-basics

This simple tutorial helped me out a lot to get started (Once Installed):

## Routes
### Hello World Route
This is the first visible route when the project is ran. It simply says "Hello World!" in the App Bar and has a "Continue..." button to move to the next route.
### Color Switcher
This is the route displayed when the user clicks on the "Continue" button. It displays "Color Switcher" in the App Bar and has a button that toggles and updates the state for the button text as well as for the background color.
### Images
The Images/ folder in this repository shows how my application looks when ran.
